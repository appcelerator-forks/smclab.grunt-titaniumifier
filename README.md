Get a Titanium CommonJS Module out of your Node.js package with [Titaniumifier](https://github.com/smclab/titaniumifier) using Grunt!

Read the [documentation of `titaniumifier`][wiki] to understand what you can do with it.


Getting Started
---------------

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.2`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-titaniumifier --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-titaniumifier');
```

The "titaniumifier" task
------------------------

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `titaniumifier` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  titaniumifier: {
    "module": {
      options: {
        // You can create a CommonJS module **without** the
        // dependencies bundled
        bare: false,
        // Specifying bundle:true you will have a bundled JS file alongside the
        // zipfile, so you can distribute it as a single file
        bundle: false,
        // If you donâ€™t even need the zipfile (why??!) you can exclude it from
        // the building process
        module: true
      }
    }
  },
});
```

Most of the configuration must happen on the `package.json` file, please see the [documentation of `titaniumifier`][wiki] to see what you can do.
